# react-hgmaps-core
react-hgmaps-core is a dead-simple (and extendable) Google Maps React component that uses react hooks. The goal is to make it easy to extend upon without using any library/component specific logic. 

At the very best, work in progress. Will at some point hopefully become a NPM module.
